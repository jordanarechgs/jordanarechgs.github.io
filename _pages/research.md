My research examines how organizations create value for both business and society, with a focus on corporate purpose, social innovation, and societal impact.

I am particularly interested in:

- Benefit Corporations (Società Benefit) and hybrid organizational forms  
- The performance implications of purpose-driven strategies  
- Social impact measurement and evaluation  
- The relationship between business strategy and societal value creation
